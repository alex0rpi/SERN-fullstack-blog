## Fullstack SERN blog app

This app uses mysql as database (hence the S instead of the M at the acronym). 
Mysql is setup using the Sequelize ORM.

### Some pending tasks:
* Add .env vars
* Modify database configuration so it is created automatically on a local server.

### How to try
* Clone the repository.
* Execute client and server side on separate terminals.
